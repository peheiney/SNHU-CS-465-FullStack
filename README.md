CS-465 Full Stack Development I

Architecture

In our full stack project, we utilized multiple frontend development technologies, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) framework. Express HTML was primarily used for rendering server-side templates, while JavaScript was crucial for client-side interactivity. The SPA framework, on the other hand, enabled seamless navigation within the application without full page reloads. Each of these technologies offers distinct advantages and trade-offs in terms of performance, development speed, and maintainability.

Regarding the backend, we opted for a NoSQL MongoDB database for its flexibility and scalability. NoSQL databases like MongoDB are well-suited for applications with rapidly changing data schemas and large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. This choice allowed us to efficiently store and retrieve data while accommodating future changes and growth in our application.

Functionality

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) serves as a lightweight data interchange format that is independent of programming languages. It facilitates communication between the frontend and backend by providing a standardized format for transmitting structured data. Throughout the full stack development process, we leveraged JSON to pass data between the client and server, ensuring seamless integration and interoperability.

Refactoring code to improve functionality and efficiency was a recurring aspect of our development process. By identifying and consolidating repetitive or redundant code segments, we were able to create reusable user interface (UI) components. These reusable components not only enhanced code maintainability but also contributed to a more consistent and efficient development workflow.

Testing

In a full stack application, various methods for request and retrieval necessitate comprehensive API testing of endpoints. This includes testing for functionality, data integrity, and error handling across different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Additionally, the presence of added security layers introduces complexities in testing, requiring thorough examination of authentication and authorization mechanisms. Understanding methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application is crucial for ensuring the reliability and security of the application.

Reflection

This course has been instrumental in helping me progress towards my professional goals by equipping me with valuable skills and knowledge in full stack development. Throughout the course, I've learned to design and implement complex web applications, honing my skills in frontend and backend development, database management, and API integration. These skills not only make me a more versatile developer but also enhance my competitiveness in the job market. Additionally, the emphasis on testing methodologies and best practices has instilled in me a commitment to delivering high-quality, robust software solutions, further bolstering my marketability as a candidate in the field of web development.
